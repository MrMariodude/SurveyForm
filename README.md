# Survey Form Project

This is a simple survey form project for freeCodeCamp. The form collects user data to help improve the platform. Users can provide their name, email, and optionally their age. They can also select their current role, favorite feature of freeCodeCamp, and whether they would recommend the platform to a friend. Additionally, users can check options they would like to see improved and provide any comments or suggestions.
